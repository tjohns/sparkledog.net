Earlier today at [GDG DevFest West](http://devfestwest.com) I gave a presentation titled "Android's Social APIs". We discussed overing topics like the Social Stream APIs, near-field communication (NSD), network service discovery (NSD), and WiFi Direct. These arew some of my favorite APIs, so this was a fun talk to give.

Some folks were asking for a copy of the slides, so I just uploaded them online. There's not much here that isn't covered in the documentation or official blog posts, but it's a good summary if any of this is new to you. Hopefully you'll find it useful.
