After many years of terrible procrastination, I finally sat down and decided to publish a blog.

My original plan for this site was to use a custom blogging engine I had written on top of [Camping][1]. But I realized that I was spending a lot of time trying to perfect that rather than launching.

It was a cool project; it did a few things that I felt was lacking in other blogging systems. But while I was working on that, I wasn't actually writing. My users -- potential readers -- don't get any benefit from a blog that doesn't exist.

So I decided to spend the last week quickly designing a new layout (the old one had too much brown!), polishing things up, and getting things done. I'll still finish up that blogging engine, but for now I'm using [Jekyll][2] becasuse it does almost everything I need.

(Admittedly, I'm also a fan of Jekyll's simple architecture. Combined with GitHub Pages and prose.io, it's a very elegant solution to publishing.)

So, here we are. I hope you'll find my writing enlightening, or at least entertaining. And if you're working on any projects of your own, remember: Perfect is the enemy of the good. Launch now.

_And we have lift-off!_
